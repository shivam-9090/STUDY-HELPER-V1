# Study Helper AI - Sidebar & History Implementation

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### Backend (Flask + SQLAlchemy)

1. **Database Models** (`models/database.py`):
   - `User`: Stores user information (id, username, email, created_at)
   - `ChatHistory`: Stores all chat conversations (id, user_id, subject, question, answer, created_at)
   - `StudyPlan`: Stores generated study plans (id, user_id, subject, topic, plan, created_at, is_active)

2. **User Management API** (`routes/user_routes.py`):
   - `POST /api/user/create` - Create or get existing user
   - `GET /api/user/<id>` - Get user details
   - `GET /api/user/<id>/stats` - Get user statistics
   - `GET /api/user/<id>/history` - Get chat history (with filters)
   - `POST /api/user/<id>/history` - Save chat to history
   - `DELETE /api/user/<id>/history/<chat_id>` - Delete specific chat
   - `DELETE /api/user/<id>/history/clear` - Clear all history
   - `GET /api/user/<id>/study-plans` - Get study plans
   - `POST /api/user/<id>/study-plans` - Save study plan
   - `PUT /api/user/<id>/study-plans/<plan_id>` - Update study plan
   - `DELETE /api/user/<id>/study-plans/<plan_id>` - Delete study plan

3. **Database Integration** (`app.py`):
   - SQLite database: `backend/study_helper.db`
   - Auto-creates tables on startup
   - Registered user_bp blueprint

### Frontend (Flutter)

1. **App Drawer Sidebar** (`lib/widgets/app_drawer.dart`):
   - Beautiful gradient design matching app theme
   - User profile header with avatar
   - Menu items:
     - 📜 Chat History - View previous conversations
     - 📚 Study Plans - Saved study plans
     - 📊 Statistics - Learning progress
     - ⚙️ Settings - App preferences
   - Animated gradient cards for each menu item
   - Version info in footer

2. **History Screen** (`lib/screens/history_screen.dart`):
   - View all past chat conversations
   - Filter by subject (All/Mathematics/Physics/CS/etc.)
   - Beautiful card-based UI with animations
   - Subject-colored badges
   - Date formatting (Today, Yesterday, X days ago)
   - Delete individual chats
   - Clear all history (with confirmation)
   - Pull to refresh
   - Empty state with helpful message
   - Click to view full conversation in dialog

3. **Auto-Save to History** (`lib/screens/chat_screen.dart`):
   - Automatically saves each chat conversation
   - Saves question, answer, and subject
   - Background saving (doesn't interrupt user)

4. **User Creation** (`lib/main.dart`):
   - Creates default user on app startup
   - Ensures user exists before app starts

5. **Navigation** (`lib/screens/home_screen.dart`):
   - Added drawer to main screen
   - Swipe from left to open sidebar

## 🎨 Design Features

- **Gradient Themes**: Blue/purple gradients throughout
- **Animations**: Staggered fade-in animations for history cards
- **Subject Colors**: Each subject has unique color coding
- **Material Design 3**: Modern Flutter UI components
- **Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes
