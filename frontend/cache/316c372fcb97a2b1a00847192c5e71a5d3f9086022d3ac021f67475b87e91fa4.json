  "response": "Okay, here's a 4-week study plan for Data Structures in Computer Science, designed to build a solid foundation and progress towards more advanced concepts.\n\n### Week 1: Foundation\n- **What:**\n    *   Arrays and Lists (Static vs. Dynamic)\n    *   Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)\n    *   Stacks and Queues\n    *   Basic Time Complexity Analysis (Big O Notation)\n- **Tasks:**\n    1.  Implement a dynamic array (growable array) from scratch in your preferred language.\n    2.  Implement a Singly Linked List with `add`, `remove`, `search`, and `print` methods.\n    3.  Solve a problem using a Stack (e.g., balanced parentheses checker) and a problem using a Queue (e.g., simple job scheduler).\n- **Time:** 5-7h\n- **Tips:** Focus on understanding the underlying memory structure and how operations affect performance. Draw diagrams to visualize the data structures.\n- **Metrics:** Successfully implement the data structures and solve the problems. Understand the time complexity of each operation.\n\n### Week 2: Intermediate\n- **What:**\n    *   Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees - BST)\n    *   Tree Traversal Algorithms (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, Breadth-First Search)\n    *   Hash Tables (Collision Resolution Techniques)\n    *   Heaps (Binary Heaps, Priority Queues)\n- **Tasks:**\n    1.  Implement a Binary Search Tree with `insert`, `delete`, `search`, and `inorder traversal` methods.\n    2.  Implement a Hash Table using separate chaining or open addressing for collision resolution.\n    3.  Solve a problem using a Heap (e.g., find the Kth largest element in an array).\n- **Time:** 6-8h\n- **Tips:** Pay close attention to the recursive nature of tree traversals. Understand the trade-offs between different collision resolution techniques in hash tables.\n- **Metrics:** Successfully implement the data structures and solve the problems. Understand the average and worst-case time complexities of operations on each structure.\n\n### Week 3: Advanced\n- **What:**\n    *   Balanced Trees (AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees)\n    *   Graphs (Representations: Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List)\n    *   Graph Traversal Algorithms (Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search)\n    *   Graph Algorithms (Shortest Path Algorithms: Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford)\n- **Tasks:**\n    1.  Implement either an AVL Tree or a Red-Black Tree with insertion and balancing operations.\n    2.  Implement a graph using an adjacency list representation. Implement DFS and BFS traversals.\n    3.  Solve a shortest path problem using Dijkstra's algorithm on a weighted graph.\n-   **Time:** 7-9h\n-   **Tips:** Balanced trees are complex; focus on understanding the balancing principles.  Graph algorithms can be challenging; draw diagrams and trace the execution of the algorithms on sample graphs.\n-   **Metrics:** Successfully implement the data structures and solve the problems.  Understand the time and space complexities of graph algorithms.\n\n### Week 4: Review\n- **Revision, practice, test**\n    *   **Review:** Go through all the data structures and algorithms covered in the previous weeks. Focus on areas where you feel less confident.  Revisit the code you wrote and identify potential improvements.\n    *   **Practice:** Solve a variety of coding problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or Codeforces. Focus on problems that require you to apply the data structures and algorithms you've learned.\n    *   **Test:** Take a mock interview or solve a timed problem set to simulate real-world coding scenarios.\n- **Time:** 6-8h\n- **Tips:** Prioritize solving problems over just reading about the concepts. Focus on understanding *why* a particular data structure or algorithm is suitable for a given problem. Practice explaining your solutions clearly and concisely.\n- **Metrics:**  Solve a diverse set of problems successfully.  Identify and address any remaining gaps in your knowledge.  Feel confident in your ability to apply data structures and algorithms to solve coding problems.\n\n**General Tips & Considerations:**\n\n*   **Choose a Language:** Stick to one programming language throughout the study plan.  Python, Java, and C++ are popular choices for data structures.\n*   **Active Learning:** Don't just passively read or watch tutorials.  Actively implement the data structures and algorithms yourself.\n*   **Debugging:** Embrace debugging as a learning opportunity.  Understand *why* your code is not working and how to fix it.\n*   **Resources:** Use a combination of textbooks, online courses, and coding platforms. Some popular resources include:\n    *   \"Introduction to Algorithms\" by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein (CLRS)\n    *   \"Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C++\" by Mark Allen Weiss\n    *   LeetCode\n    *   Coursera/edX courses on Data Structures and Algorithms\n*   **Consistency:**  Try to study regularly, even if it's just for an hour each day.\n*   **Adaptability:**  Adjust the plan based on your progress and learning style. If you find a particular topic challenging, spend more time on it.\n*   **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:**  If you're stuck, don't hesitate to ask for help from online forums, communities, or mentors.\n*   **Example Problems:** Look for example problems that require the use of specific data structures. This can help you understand how to apply them in real-world scenarios.\n*   **Visualize:** Use online tools or draw diagrams to visualize the data structures and algorithms. This can help you understand how they work.\n\nGood luck with your data structures journey!\n",
