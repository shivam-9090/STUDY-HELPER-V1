# 🚀 Google Play Store Deployment Guide - Study Helper AI

This guide will help you prepare and deploy your Study Helper AI app to Google Play Store.

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. **Create Release Keystore** (REQUIRED)

# You'll be prompted for:
# - Keystore password (REMEMBER THIS!)
# - Key password (REMEMBER THIS!)
# - Your name
# - Organization
