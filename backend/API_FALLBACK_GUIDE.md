# 🚀 Smart API Fallback System

## ✅ What I've Implemented

Your Study Helper now has an **intelligent multi-API key system** with automatic fallback and rate limiting!

## 📋 Features

### 1. **Multiple API Key Support**
- Primary key + unlimited backup keys
- Automatic switching when one fails
- No downtime for users

### 2. **Smart Rate Limiting**
- Tracks requests per minute for each key
- Free tier: 15 requests/minute per key
- Auto-switches before hitting limits

### 3. **Intelligent Fallback**
- If Key 1 hits quota → switches to Key 2
- If Key 2 hits quota → switches to Key 3
- If all keys exhausted → waits 60 seconds and retries
- Marks failed keys temporarily and recovers them

### 4. **User-Friendly Error Messages**
- Clear explanations when limits are reached
- Suggestions for solutions
- No scary technical errors

## 🔧 How to Add More API Keys

### Option 1: Get Multiple Free API Keys
1. Go to https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
2. Create API keys in **different Google accounts**
3. Each account gets its own free tier quota!

### Option 2: Update `.env` File

```env
# Primary key
AI_API_KEY=AIzaSyBeqBO1eYl7ZLTOUDpPP165eJcNuzqbev8

# Backup keys (add as many as you want!)
AI_API_KEY_BACKUP=AIzaSyDBNUHQg71m52IYBL97oPH6yDrhS4G1rqs
AI_API_KEY_BACKUP_2=your_third_key_here
AI_API_KEY_BACKUP_3=your_fourth_key_here
AI_API_KEY_BACKUP_4=your_fifth_key_here
# ... up to AI_API_KEY_BACKUP_9
```

## 📊 Quota Calculation

### With 1 API Key:
- 15 requests/minute
- 1,500 requests/day
- = **90 students using app simultaneously**

### With 3 API Keys:
- 45 requests/minute
- 4,500 requests/day
- = **270+ students using app simultaneously**

### With 5 API Keys:
- 75 requests/minute
- 7,500 requests/day
- = **450+ students using app simultaneously**

## 🎯 How It Works Behind the Scenes

```
User asks question
    ↓
Try Primary Key
    ↓
Success? → Return answer ✅
    ↓

    ↓
Success? → Return answer ✅
    ↓
429 Error? → Switch to Backup Key 2
    ↓
... continues through all keys ...
    ↓
All keys failed? → Wait 60s → Retry
```

## 💡 Best Practices

### 1. **Create Keys from Different Google Accounts**
Each Google account gets separate quota limits!

### 2. **Monitor Usage**
- Check https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key
- View usage dashboard for each key

### 3. **Rotate Keys Strategically**
- Morning rush: Key 1, 2, 3
- Afternoon: Key 4, 5
- Evening: Key 1, 2 (quotas reset!)

### 4. **Upgrade When Needed**
If you get consistent traffic, consider:
- Google Cloud paid tier ($0.125 per 1M tokens)
- Very cheap for student apps
- Unlimited quota with billing enabled

## 🔥 Current Status

✅ **Implemented Features:**
- Multi-key loading from .env
- Automatic rate limit tracking
- Smart key switching
- Retry logic with backoff
- User-friendly error messages

✅ **Active Keys:**
- Primary: AIzaSyBeqBO1eYl7ZLTOUDpPP165eJcNuzqbev8 (WORKING)
